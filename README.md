# CProjects

**ClothesStore.c is a C program that uses functions, arrays of structures and files.**

This program is to manage a stock of products in clothes store:

 Each product has a code, a brand, a name, a size, a price, a quantity in
stock and a minimum quantity in stock. Each can be identified by its code or by its name. The code is unique and is assigned by the system itself. When the quantity in stock for a particular product falls below the minimum stock quantity, the system sends
information for the screen, to warn of the need to order more units from the product.

The program contains a main menu that allows the user to choose:

1- Introduce a new product;

2- Check in a new quantity of a certain product;

3- Check out a certain quantity of a certain product;
